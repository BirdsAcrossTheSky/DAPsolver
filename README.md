# DAPsolver
Program implementing heurestic method of solving Dynamic ALlocation Path (DAP) problem. This program takes as an input a specifically constructed file which contains data (such as links, capacities, demands) of a network. 
Through changing parameters in control panel section in code it is possible to determine following values:
  1. population size - number of chromosomes in population
  2. mutation rates - chance for mutation of a chromosome and its genes
  3. ascendants number - number of chromosmes created through crossover
  4. max iteration number without improvement - end condition of program loop
