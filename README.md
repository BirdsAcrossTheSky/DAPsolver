# DAPsolver
Program implementing heurestic method of solving Dynamic Allocation Path (DAP) problem. This program takes as an input a specifically constructed file which contains data of a network (such as information about links, capacities, demands). Program parse data and based on that it looks for the best sollution
Through changing parameters in control panel section in code it is possible to determine following values:
  1. population size - number of chromosomes in population
  2. mutation rates - chance for mutation of a chromosome and its genes
  3. ascendants number - number of chromosmes created through crossover
  4. max iteration number without improvement - end condition of program loop
